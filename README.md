Omnicatcher
===========

Omnicatcher is a game developed by Nonon Jakuzure with great dedication to the crypto currency OmniCoin which is a common standard of an internet forum known as Hack Forums which is run by a webmaster who operates under the internet alias 'Omniscient'

This game is with the intent to have fun in a simplistic environment with a theme of the great crypto currency. Sadly, Omnicatcher will not give you actual Omnicoins, but if it does, I'm sure you'll be informed.

Some things the original developers would like to do:
-Game Over type objects
-Menus
-Maybe some 64bit music that fits the game, if I can find any.
-A proper background image.
-Difficulty settings.
-Better looking text than the shitty one used.
